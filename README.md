# Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning for User Data

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyze sensitive user data while ensuring privacy. We implemented techniques such as differential privacy and federated learning to allow for predictive text input and personalized recommendations without compromising user data security.

## Key Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Tools:** CoreML, Jupyter

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for implementing differential privacy, federated learning, and the model.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the implemented methods.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhisekjha/privacy-preserving-ml.git
    cd privacy-preserving-ml
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess the data:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/model_training.ipynb
    ```

## Impact
- Enabled secure and private analysis of user data.
- Demonstrated compliance with strict privacy standards.
- Improved user trust and satisfaction with privacy-first features.
